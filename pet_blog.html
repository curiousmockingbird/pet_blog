      <p>
        This is Luna, a 1 and half y.o. Maltese dog found on the streets of
        Mexico D.F. My wife brought her to the U.S. earlier this year, and now
        she is the litle spoiled one of the house.

      <h1>Things I like about Luna:</h1>
      <ul>
        <li>She is not a barker.</li>
        <li>She wakes up/goes to sleep exactly when we do it at home.</li>
        <li>She is both calm and playful.</li>
        <li>
          She likes chasing squirrels and bunnies, but not in a violent way.
        </li>
      </ul>
